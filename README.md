ScrollViewPager 
===============

This is my a bone to pick problem. And tonight I decided to use ScrollView without any PageController and other static stuff.
Basically I use storyboard and ViewControllers for ScrollView. I didn't want to use ScrollView's delegate methods. I find a solution a few lines of code.
