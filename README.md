ScrollViewPager 
===============

This is my a bone to pick problem. And tonight I decided to use ScrollView without any PageController and other static stuff.
Basically I use storyboard and ViewControllers for ScrollView. Also get out of to use ScrollView's delegate methods. I find a solution a few lines of code. 

If you curious about whats going on this project **ViewController.m** only place you should look.
